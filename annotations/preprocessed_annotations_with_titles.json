This immediately evokes humor due to the absurdity of the scene. The satire stems from the commentary on the often-absurd nature of medical procedures and the anxieties they can create. The patient's possible reaction to seeing a doctor in such attire contributes to the feeling of confusion. The combination of these elements makes the overall tone predominantly humorous and satirical, with a tinge of confusion arising from the unconventional scenario.",
